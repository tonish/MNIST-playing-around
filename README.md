# MNIST-playing-around

This repo was my intro to cnn and pytorch after doing many many tutorials.

I load a pretrained model, and change it to accept one channel MNIST images, and also to go from 224 * 224 image size to 28*28.

I save and load checkpoints.

I use a learning rate scheduler.
I use tqdm.
I use tensor board for later inspection.
Tensoroard --logdir runs //runs is the directory of the saved files
